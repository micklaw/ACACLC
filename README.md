# ACACLC
*Test for AC, and bit of a laugh for me.* 


## Introduction

This has been a fun playgound for getting a feel around Client-side Blazor and what it entails. Blazor feels very early stages, but poses an interesting view on the future landscape of the web and once you get used to the debugging side, was actually quite nice to use. 

It may not feel fully production ready yet, but for me WASM in some form could be a JS killer.

Absolute bonus is the ability to host dotnet core code in gh-pages branches :) Takes a bit of messing about with as it's not on a root domain, but all good.

The app is written in dotnet core 3.0, C# and uses a new WASM framework called Blazor. Though experimental it does showcase some the dotnet skills I have, though not in real low level detail due to time restrictions :( I thought the guys would maybe be a bit fed up of seeing submissions using JS frameworks or standard MVC apps so thought I'd mix it up a little and do some learning for me too.
