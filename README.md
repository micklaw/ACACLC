# ACACLC
*Test for AC, and bit of a laugh for me.* 


## Introduction

This has been a fun playgound for getting a feel around Client-side Blazor and what it entails. It feels very early stages, but poses an interesting view on the future landscape of the web. 

It may not feel fully production ready yet, but for me WASM in some form could be a JS killer.

Absolute bonus is the ability to host dotnet core code in gh-pages branches :) Takes a bit of messing about with as it's not on a root domain, but all good.
